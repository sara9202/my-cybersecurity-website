        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Sara, a dedicated Computer Programming and Analysis student with a passion for cybersecurity. As someone who thrives on problem-solving and loves diving deep into the world of digital security, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and make an impact in this ever-evolving field.</p>

        <p>My technical skills include proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, Java, C#, Bash scripting, and Linux. Additionally, I have a solid foundation in IT fundamentals, which has helped me develop a versatile toolkit for tackling various challenges in programming and cybersecurity.</p>

        <p>Currently, I'm working on several personal projects that focus on areas like encryption, secure web development, and network security. I'm also preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification exam, which I plan to take later this year. This exam is just one step in my journey toward building a career that combines my passion for technology with my commitment to safeguarding information.</p>

        <p>My goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to the cybersecurity community, protect critical assets, and make the digital world a safer place. I am driven by curiosity, motivated by challenge, and always eager to learn new things. Whether it’s exploring the latest security tools or understanding emerging threats, I’m always ready to dive in headfirst.</p>
