    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> A weakness or flaw in a system that can be exploited by a threat actor.</li>
        <li><strong>Threat:</strong> A potential danger or risk that could exploit a vulnerability.</li>
        <li><strong>Threat Actor:</strong> An entity, such as a hacker or malicious software, with the intent to cause harm or exploit vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploit:</strong> The act of successfully taking advantage of a vulnerability by a threat actor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Importance of Controls and Countermeasures</h3>
    <p>To mitigate risks and enhance security, organizations implement various controls and countermeasures. These are designed to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities within systems.</li>
        <li>Minimize the likelihood of a threat actor successfully exploiting a vulnerability.</li>
        <li>Reduce or eliminate the impact of a potential exploit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Control Objectives:</strong> Specific goals set to achieve desired security outcomes by implementing the appropriate controls.</p>
    <p><strong>Countermeasures:</strong> Reactive controls implemented to address specific threats and reduce their impact.</p>

    <h3>Diversity and Layered Security</h3>
    <p>Effective cybersecurity strategies rely on the principle of control diversity, ensuring that no single point of failure exists. This approach, known as <strong>Defense in Depth</strong> (or layered security), involves implementing multiple overlapping layers of different types of controls to create a robust defense against potential threats. Each control should function independently to avoid a cascading failure if one control is compromised.</p>

    <h3>Control Categories and Classifications</h3>
    <p>Controls in cybersecurity are categorized into several types based on their function and implementation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Controls:</strong> Implemented using hardware, software, or firmware to protect systems (e.g., firewalls, encryption, authentication systems).</li>
        <li><strong>Managerial Controls:</strong> Related to governance, risk management, and strategic decision-making (e.g., risk assessments, project management).</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Controls:</strong> Processes primarily executed by people to maintain security (e.g., training, change management).</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Controls:</strong> Measures designed to protect physical assets and facilities (e.g., locks, surveillance cameras, fences).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The CIA Triad: Foundation of Information Security</h3>
    <p>The CIA Triad is a fundamental model in cybersecurity, guiding the development of security policies and strategies. It consists of three core principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to view it. This involves safeguarding data from unauthorized access and disclosure.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Ensuring that data is accurate, authentic, and reliable. It involves protecting data from unauthorized alterations, ensuring that it remains unchanged during transit and storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed. It involves maintaining system functionality and uptime.</li>
    </ul>

            <h2>Understanding Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</h2>
            <p>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework that includes programs, data formats, procedures, communication protocols, security policies, and cryptographic mechanisms to ensure secure digital communications. PKI supports the use of cryptographic keys and certificates to secure data transmission over networks.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Types of Encryption</h2>
            <h3>Symmetric Key Encryption</h3>
            <p>Symmetric key encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. This means the same key must be securely shared between the sender and receiver to maintain confidentiality.</p>

            <h3>Asymmetric Key Encryption</h3>
            <p>Asymmetric key encryption uses two keys: a public key and a private key. These keys are mathematically related and generated simultaneously. The public key is freely available to anyone, while the private key is kept secret by its owner. Only the private key can decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding public key.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Management Concepts</h2>
            <h3>Creating a Public-Private Key Pair</h3>
            <p>Public-private key pairs are created together using large prime numbers and complex cryptographic algorithms. The private key remains confidential, while the public key is distributed freely.</p>

            <h3>Key Escrow</h3>
            <p>Key escrow involves a third party managing your keys, which can be useful if a user leaves an organization or when government agencies need access to encrypted data.</p>

            <h3>Key Strength and Security</h3>
            <p>The strength of a cryptographic key is determined by its length. Longer keys provide more security against brute force attacks. For example, keys of 128 bits or larger are common, and asymmetric keys are often 2048 bits or longer. Hashing and key strengthening techniques can also enhance key security.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Encryption Methods</h2>
            <h3>Encrypting Stored Data</h3>
            <p>Encrypting File System (EFS) is a method of transparent encryption using symmetric keys to protect data at rest.</p>

            <h3>Transport Encryption</h3>
            <p>Transport encryption protects data traveling across networks. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and other secure protocols are commonly used for this purpose.</p>

            <h3>Encryption Algorithms</h3>
            <p>Common symmetric algorithms include DES, 3DES, AES, and RC4. Asymmetric algorithms include RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman, and ElGamal, each with specific use cases such as key exchange and digital signatures.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Advanced Cryptographic Tools</h2>
            <h3>Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and Hardware Security Module (HSM)</h3>
            <p>A TPM is a hardware chip used to store cryptographic keys securely. In large-scale environments, a Hardware Security Module (HSM) offers tamper-resistant protection for managing and storing cryptographic keys.</p>

            <h3>Secure Enclave</h3>
            <p>A secure enclave is a separate processor within a device designed to protect data privacy and perform real-time encryption tasks securely, even if the main device is compromised.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Types of Attacks</h2>
